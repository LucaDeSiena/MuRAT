MuRAT - Multi-Resolution Seismic Attenuation Tomography
=======

Getting Started
-------

MuRAT is a Matlab Package for Seismic Attenuation, SCattering and Absorption Tomography using Body and Coda Waves. 


*Features*
--------

* MuRAT is a complete software package for measuring seismic attenuation, scattering, and absorption from passive and active data, and model 3D variations of these parameters in space.

* MuRAT1.0 was first developed by Luca De Siena (Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany) during his PhD at the INGV-Osservatorio Vesuviano, Italy, and published in 2014 while he was research assistant at the Westfälisches Wilhelms Universität, Münster. Murat1.0 allowed 3D total attenuation imaging with the coda-normalization method (*Del Pezzo et al. 2006, PEPI; De Siena et al. 2008 PEPI; De Siena et al. 2009, JGR; De Siena et al. 2014a, JVGR; De Siena et al. 2014a, JVGR; De Siena et al. 2014b, JGR; Prudencio et al. 2015a, Surv. in Geoph.; Prudencio et al. 2015b, Surv. in Geoph.*).

* MuRAT2.0 is the result of the activity of the Volcano Earth Imaging group, led by De Siena during his stint as permanent Lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, UK and now as Associate Professor in Geophysics at JGU Mainz. Murat2.0 adds to Murat1.0 the choice to produce 2D seismic scattering (peak delay) and absorption (Qc at late lapse time - kernel-based or not. It is ideal for small datasets and in case no previous velocity information is available (*Calvet et al. 2013, Tectonophysics; De Siena et al. 2016; Borleanu et al. 2017; De Siena et al. 2017a, GRL; De Siena et al. 2017b, Sci. Rep.; Akande et al. 2019; Napolitano et al. 2020, Geoscience Frontiers; Sketsiou et al. 2020, PEPI*).

* The group of active users (providing questions, feedback, snippets of code) is the Volcano Earth Imaging group - www.lucadesiena.com.

*History*
-------

* 2006-2010: MuRAT (at the time named "Multi-scale reasonable attenuation tomography analysis") is built using Matlab, c++, csh and Fortran codes mostly developed at INGV-Osservatorio.

* 2010-2013: MuRAT1.0 is developed as a 3D direct-wave attenuation imaging Matlab-only code with the contribution of Christine Thomas (WWU Münster) and Richard Aster (Colorado State University).

* 2014: MuRAT1.0 is published in De Siena et al. 2014, JVGR, with two sample datasets (Mount St. Helens and Vesuvius) [JVGR article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027314000961)

* 2018: MuRAT2.0 is released including 2D scattering/absorption mapping and kernel-based inversion and re-branded Multi-Resolution Seismic Attenuation Tomography. [GitHub Repository] (https://github.com/LucaDeSiena/MuRAT)

* 2019: MuRAT2.1 is released, fixing most of the bugs and adding the Pollino dataset.

* January 2021: MuRAt3.0 is released as a parallelized code for full 3D attenuation, scattering and absorption imaging using peak delays, coda attenuation and coda-normalized energies.

*Documentation*
-------------

The full documentation for MuRAT3.0 can be found in html files associated with the software. This README file and the linked internet sites are to be used as a reference. 

*Installation and running*
------------

SYSTEM: The program works on Mac, Linux and Windows systems equipped with Matlab R2019a.

Necessary Toolboxes: Signal Processing, Curve Fitting, Image Processing and Mapping. The Parallel Computing Toolbox is recommended for speed.

Two sample datasets (Mount St. Helens and Romania) are included and allow the user to obtain sample models. The  datasets work with the two input .mlx files that are provided and show examples of what the user can obtain with the code. 

The current version works following these steps:

1. Download the package at https://github.com/LucaDeSiena/MuRAT.

2. Open one of the two input .mlx files that provide a step by step explanation of all inputs (Murat_input_MSH.mlx or Murat_input_Romania.mlx) and create your own. The API documentation is created as html files from the .mlx of the primary functions used by the code.

3. MuRAT works with SAC files (https://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/) that must be stored all into a single folder and be possibly corrected for the instrument function. The files must have populated headers, although the code can work using only the following header fields:

              a. The P-wave picking in the reference system of the waveform.
              b. The coordinates of the event.
              c. The coordinates of the station.
              d. The origin time of the event (optional).

4. Run MuRAT3 and select the name of the input file desired.

*Instructions*
------------

To work with MuRAT, follow these steps:

1. **Start from the Murat_input.. files**

The input files are self-explicative .mlx files providing detailed descriptions of every input and references to papers you can use to set them. If you have a 3D velocity model use the MSH file otherwise pick MuRAT_Romania.

------------

2. **Read the html**

The package has a html folder that explains what each main function does: read them to understand the approximations used to process data, forward model kernels, and invert observations

------------


3. **The output text files**

All the output files (.txt), figures and .vtk files (for visualisation in Paraview) are stored in sub-directories in the **Label** folder, created in the **Working Directory**. Use the html Murat_plot html file to have information about what each plot means and how it is created. In the following, a list of the output files and what they contain is provided.

Inside the *TXT* subfolder, the first three columns of each output file correspond to WE, SN, and depth. The fourth column is the mapped parameter. In ascii format, they contain a minimum of five columns (for *Peak Delay*) that can be imported to show the locations of the anomalies in a simple (x,y,z) reference system. The fifth columns shows blocks hit by at least one ray.

*Qc.txt* and *Q3D.txt* are solved with an inversion and thus have:

      A. a sixth and seventh columns that corresponds to the input and output of the checkerboard test;
      B. eight and nineth columns that corresponds to the input and output of the spike test;
      C. a 10th column for the model resolution matrix.

All the .vtk files are stored into the VTK subfolder.

4. **The output figure files**

All the figures (in the **Figures Format** defined by the user) are stored in subdirectories in the **Label** folder, created in the **Working Directory**. 

*Rays.Figures format*

A figure to show how rays develop in 3D for the Peak Delay and Q measurements. It plots them on three slices (WE, SN, Z). The fourth panel shows the location of the area on the Earth.

------------
*Kernel-Qc.Figures format* 

Two panels showing the sensitivity kernels in the entire 3D space (left) and the normalised kernels in the chosen inversion grid (right). This reduction implies several hypotheses: among these the most important is that most of the energy is still comprised in the grid (the difference is general < 1% if all source and stations are in the inversion grid.

------------
*Qc_Peak_Delay.Figures format*

A figure to evaluate the appropriate peak-delay and coda inputs. The upper panel should show a constant inverse Qc with travel time. The lower panel should show a linearly-increasing peak delay with travel time.

------------
*Lc_Qc.Figures format and Lc_CN.Figures format*

L-curves corresponding to the coda-attenuation and total-attenuation inversion. After they appear, a prompt asks which damping parameter the user wants to pick. 

------------
*Picard_Qc.Figures format and Picard_CN.Figures format*

These plots show the result of the Picard criterium, necessary to evaluate how many of the inversion parameters are correctively solved in the coda-attenuation and total-attenuation inversions, respectively. The two figures do not appear during computation.

------------
*Peak_delay-3D.fig*, *Qc-3D.fig* and *Q-3D.fig*

These plots show the result of the peak-delay, Qc and Q 3D tomography in the grid's reference system. All in Matlab .fig format, use the .vtk and Paraview for publication-quality figures.

------------
*Qc_checkerboard_input.fig*, *Qc_checkerboard_output.fig*, *Q_checkerboard_input.fig*, and *Q_checkerboard_output.fig*

These plots show the result of the checkerboard test for the Qc and Q mapping in the grid's reference system.

------------
*Qc_spike_input.fig*, *Qc_spike_output.fig*, *Q_spike_input.fig*, and *Q_spike_output.fig*

These plots show the result of the spike test for the Qc and Q mapping in the grid's reference system.

------------
*Parameter_space_variations.Figures format*

The plot shows the separation of the scattering and absorption parameters in their parameter space. Grey dots correspond to parameters too near to the average to be interpreted as scattering or absorption variations - the threshold is pre-defined at 5% of the maximum variation of each parameter. Red = High scattering and absorption; Cyan = High scattering and low absorption; Orange = Low scattering and high absorption; Green = Low scattering and absorption.

------------
*V_model.fig*

The 3D velocity model is also available as 3D figures in Matlab format. They can be loaded in Matlab and will show the vertical and horizontal slices defined in **Figures Sections**.
